## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that it's important to keep CSS minimal and classes well-named and properly categorized to make later modifications easier, especially when a new component changes the layout (like the "more" button dropdown).

I also learned how to use state and hooks in React to track information from an external API and dynamically change the page layout. For some layout-related issues I ended up having to resort to event listeners, which is something I understand should be avoided in React, but I will try to find a better solution for this.

### Continued development

I definitely intend to continue working on my CSS skills as I feel that having strong CSS fundamentals makes any front-end task significantly easier. I also want to deepen my understanding of state and props in React, as well as further practice back-end skills.
